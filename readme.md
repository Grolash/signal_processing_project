# Real-time Sound Localisation

This repository contains the code for the signal processing course project.

## Introduction of the project
Real-time signal processing consists in building systems capable of per- forming a specific task in the given time. In many fields, these types of systems are very useful as they use feedback, meaning that they adapt them- selves to control the output.

The goal of this project is to give you an intuition of the importance of online1 signal processing systems. You are going to implement a system that processes audio signals to estimate the position of a sound. At the end of this project you should be able to deploy your work on a Raspberry Pi equipped with an array of microphones to locate a sound position in real-time.
